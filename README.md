# 8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Submission

The Gaming Room created a game called Draw It or Lost it as an Android application and they wanted to improve the functionality of the software and to expand their platforms. 

In developing this documentation, I stuck to facts and kept the end user in mind for all scenerios. I had to include memory and storage options for the client and I had to document differnet options.

Analyzing the UML class diagram was helpful in understanding the structure of the entities. This was helpful in developing the classes and methods that needed to be used. 

If I had to choose one part of my work on my document to revise I would revise my design contraints. I ran into many issues that I wish I had included in that section, such as the timing of completing the application vs. costs allocated to the project and the design for the different platforms. 

It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are your target audience, you do what you do for the user, and to get the highest satifaction, you need to meet and exceed their expectations. I took all feedback seriosuly and made sure that the highest priority needs were met.

To design software, I first have to figure out my audience and what key elements need to be utilized. I have to figure out what platform I am going to use as well, is this a mobile phone application or something that will need local hardware. That is where storage and memory come in play, I need to consider what I am creating and how much I am going to create and design.
